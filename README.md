## Example Workflow

```
You: New bike theft claim - customer reports Trek mountain bike stolen from garage

Agent: To process your claim, please upload your supporting documents using this secure link:
http://your-domain.com/api/v1/ibm/file-upload/web/7b2275706c6f61645f6964223a2233396...c7a
       
       Supported formats: PDF, DOCX, TXT, MD, HTML, Images (JPG, PNG, GIF, BMP, WEBP)
       **Important**: This is a single-use link that expires after upload OR after 30 minutes.

[You upload: police_report.pdf, bike_photos.jpg, purchase_receipt.pdf, customer_statement.pdf]

You: Process this claim

Agent: Analysis complete. Here's my assessment:
       
       ✓ Police report filed 2 days after incident (acceptable timeframe)
       ✓ Photos clearly show bike model and serial number
       ✓ Customer statement is detailed and consistent
       ⚠️ Purchase receipt from 2019 - consider requesting:
         - Recent photos showing bike in customer's possession
         - Maintenance records or recent service receipts
         - Home insurance policy details (some cover personal property)
       
       🚩 Red flag: Police report lists incident time as 2:00 AM, but customer 
          statement says they discovered theft at 8:00 AM. Clarify discovery vs incident time.

You: What does the police report say about forced entry?

Agent: The police report indicates no signs of forced entry to the garage.
       The customer reported the side door was unlocked. This may affect 
       coverage depending on policy terms regarding securing property.
       Recommend reviewing policy exclusions for unsecured premises.

You: Draft a request for the additional documents we need

Agent: Here's a draft request:
       
       "Dear [Customer Name],
       
       Thank you for submitting your claim. To process this further, we need:
       
       1. Recent photos of the bicycle (dated within 6 months of theft)
       2. Maintenance or service records showing recent use
       3. Clarification: You mentioned discovering the theft at 8 AM, but the 
          police report lists 2 AM as the incident time. Please confirm.
       
       Please provide these within 5 business days..."
```
